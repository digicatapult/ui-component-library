### Bumping package versions

Following [this guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning#incrementing-semantic-versions-in-published-packages)

To see which packages have changed:

```
npx lerna changed
```

To see which lines specifically have changed:

```
npx lerna diff
```

To bump version of packages changed since the last release

```
npx lerna version
```

You should see a suggestion of changes and a propt asking "Are you sure you want to create these versions?"

##### Guide

Follow [this guide](https://github.com/digicatapult/ui-component-library/pull/1)

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

**PATCH bump examples:**

- Updating docs
- Refactoring while keeping the same usage, for instance, renaming files and things that do not affect behavior
- Fixing typos of variable or type names
- Upgrading dependencies with minor or patch releases

**MINOR bump examples:**

- New components
- New features
- CSS improvements without any style changes
- Fixing small bugs such as bugs related to browser compatibility, or bugs with property types
- Adding new property for a component

**MAJOR bump examples:**

- Anything that breaks existing behavior
- Changing the styling of a component with any visually noticeable change that will break the desired UI.
- Upgrading dependencies by major versions only if:
  - The component library somehow exposed the internals of the dependency upgraded (hence it becomes a public API change)
  - The component library needs to change its public API in a non-backward compatible way to adapt to the dependency upgraded.
    > If none of the above (for instance a bump in the package.json and rebuild without changes for a non-exported dependency), it should be a patch release.
- Changes/fixes/new features around security breaches.
